Pakistan flood toll tops 1,100 as cholera emerges PESHAWAR , Pakistan , Aug 2 , 2010 ( AFP ) The death toll from Pakistan 's worst floods in living memory stood at over 1,100 on Monday , with water - borne disease emerging as a threat to survivors . More than 1.5 million people have been affected by flash floods and landslides brought on by monsoon rain in the northwest province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Pakistani - administered Kashmir , officials said . " The floods have killed more than 1,100 people in different parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and affected over 1.5 million , " Mian Iftikhar Hussain , the province 's information minister , told AFP . " We are receiving information about the loss of life and property caused by the floods all over the province , " he said , adding that he feared the death toll could rise . A senior official at the provincial Disaster Management Authority ( PDMA ) confirmed the toll . Hussain said more than 3,700 homes had been swept away and the number of people made homeless was mounting . Hundreds of survivors sought shelter in schools in Peshawar , the main city in northwest Pakistan , and in Muzaffarabad , the capital of Pakistani Kashmir , after escaping the floods with children on their backs . The US government has announced an initial 10 - million - dollar aid pledge and has rushed helicopters and boats to Pakistan . China , which has also been hit by severe flooding , announced a 10 million yuan ( 1.5 million dollar ) donation , according to the official Xinhua news agency , which cited a government website . Hussain said rescue teams were trying to reach 1,500 tourists stranded in Swat district , the scene of a major anti - Taliban military offensive last year . " We are also getting confirmation of reports about an outbreak of cholera in some areas of Swat , " he said . The Pakistan Air Force ( PAF ) said it had airlifted more than 500 stranded people , including six foreigners , as part of relief operations and was carrying out reconnaissance missions to assess the damage to infrastructure . President Asif Ali Zardari is due in Paris Monday for a two - day visit , and French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner expressed France 's " solidarity " with Pakistan in the face of the floods . Floods also ravaged parts of Afghanistan , killing at least 65 people and affecting more than 1,000 families , officials said . Pakistani television footage and photographs taken from helicopters showed people clinging to the walls and rooftops of damaged houses as water rushed through villages . Pakistan 's weather bureau said the northwest had been hit by an " unprecedented " 312 millimetres ( 12 inches ) of rain in 36 hours . More than 300 people affected by the floods rallied in Peshawar on Sunday , chanting slogans criticising the provincial government for not providing them with adequate shelter . " I had built a two - room house on the outskirts of Peshawar with my hard - earned money but I lost it in the floods , " said 53 - year - old labourer Ejaz Khan , who joined the rally . " The government is not helping us ... the school building where I sheltered is packed with people , with no adequate arrangement for food and medicine , " Khan told AFP . The flooding capped a week of tragedy for Pakistan after an airliner crashed into hills near Islamabad on Wednesday , killing all 152 people on board .
